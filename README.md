Below are steps that should be used for teaching how to solve toy problems. It is vitally important to use this on every toy problem you do from scratch. This teaches them how to break down a toy problem and identify its parts. This is also the exact same steps that should be followed when doing white board problems, Make sure the students know that! Help them to see the value in being clear with your communication and planning. Some steps seem to be not worth while but if a student is struggling with toy problems you should be able to help them see that their problem has to do with one of the steps.
